###Implementation of the Examples from the Book *[Programming Collective Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325)* in Ruby

Example one differs from the book per [errors](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errataunconfirmed.csp?isbn=9780596529321) in the book's code.


Note: The code in the book is presented in an imperative fashion, and that style is imitated in these implementations. **This is not well factored code.**
